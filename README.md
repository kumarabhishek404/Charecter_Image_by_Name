# Charecter_Image_by_Name
This is a small project which gives a image in the response when anyone enter his name and gender, that image comes randomly with the help an API "https://joeschmoe.io/" and once any random come then that image will permanently set with that name and gender.

I used html, css and jquery in this project.
